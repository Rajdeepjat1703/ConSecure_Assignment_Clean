## Technology Stack
- **React** (with Hooks and functional components)
- **TypeScript** (type safety and maintainability)
- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first styling)
- **socket.io-client** (real-time WebSocket communication)

  ```

### 3. Run the Frontend
```sh
npm start
```
- The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## How It Works
- The frontend communicates with the backend API for all data and authentication.
- WebSocket connection is established to receive real-time analysis events.
- All state is managed with React hooks and context.

## Customization
- You can easily add new pages or components in `src/components/`.
- To change the theme or styles, edit `tailwind.config.js` and `index.css`.
